# Problem 4: Three ways to sum to n

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed (which includes `npm` and `npx`). You can verify this by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.

## How to Run

You can run the TypeScript file directly using `npx` and `ts-node`:

```bash
npx ts-node src/problem4/index.ts
```

## Expected Output

```
n = 5
sum_to_n_a: 15
sum_to_n_b: 15
sum_to_n_c: 15
```
